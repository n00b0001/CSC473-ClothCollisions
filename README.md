# CSC473-ClothCollisions
Simulates a spring-based cloth colliding with a sphere.

This simple simulator allows a "cloth" comprised of a grid of point-mass objects joined by springs to drape over a sphere. Once a point-mass collides with the sphere 500 times, it is assumed to be stationary due to friction and is anchored in place. Requires Atlas by marovira, OpenGL, and CMake to run.
To install, run CMake, then run the executable created.
